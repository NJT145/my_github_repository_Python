    "<p style=\"text-indent: 40px\">In this project we are going to work on movielens 20m dataset with <b>PySpark Dataframes</b>. \n",
    "The dataset is included in the assignment folder. You should unzip it and upload each file to the ibm's datascience tool.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand the data in each csv file, you should read README.txt file inside the folder.\n",

    "## Reliable Users\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-indent: 40px\">For the first part of this assignment you should find out the top 1000 reliable users. In order to do that you would need tags' relevance score from genome-scores.csv file. Assuming the relevance scores of movies' tags in genome-scores.csv are correct, we can find out if a user's tag to a particular movie is relevant or not. If we get the total of those relevance scores for each user then we can rank the them according to this criteria.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-indent: 40px\">One caveat is that relevance scores are between 0 and 1. We want to scale it between -1 and 1 and also we want to punish more if the issued tag is not relevant. First multiply relevance with 20 and then substract 12 so relevance score range will be between -12 and 8 and then apply hyperbolic tangent. That way relevance's range will be between -1 and 1.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-indent: 40px\"> Note: You should use PySpark's <b>tanh</b> function. Also use caching appropriately in order to be able to get the results in a reasonable time.</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-indent: 40px\"> Caution: Do not use RDDs. Every operation should be done on the executors not in the driver machine.</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-indent: 40px\">Important: Do not discuss the solution with your friends. <b>Plagiarism</b> will not be tolerated and issue will be referred to the <b>disciplinary committee</b>.</p>\n",
